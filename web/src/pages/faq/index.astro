    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is the Customer Leak Scan?',
        answer:
          'It is a free 20–30 minute live call where we review your website and identify where potential customers are dropping off due to performance, tracking, structure, or ownership issues.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this a sales call?',
        answer:
          'No. The call is a working session. You receive a clear Go / No-Go verdict on whether your website is ready to scale safely. Implementation is discussed only if it genuinely makes sense.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Who is the Customer Leak Scan for?',
        answer:
          'Owner-led service businesses in Alberta that already have a website and want to understand whether it is capturing customers — or quietly losing them.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is the call free?',
        answer:
          'Yes. The purpose of the call is to determine fit and uncover leaks early. There is no obligation to proceed afterward.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you review anything before the call?',
        answer:
          'Yes. We pre-check your website performance, Core Web Vitals, public search presence, and basic tracking signals so the session is practical and focused.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'How We Work',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What does BrandsBuilders actually do?',
        answer:
          'We help businesses turn their websites into high-performance, fully owned growth systems. That may involve optimization or rebuilding — but only after leaks and risks are clearly identified.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you sell standalone services?',
        answer:
          'No. We do not sell isolated tactics like “just ads” or “just design.” Sending traffic to a leaking foundation wastes budget. Foundations come first.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you decide what happens after the scan?',
        answer:
          'If the website is already strong, we explain how to scale safely. If leaks are found, we outline the minimum work required to fix them. If growth is premature, we say so.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you work with my existing website?',
        answer:
          'Yes — if it meets performance, tracking, and ownership standards. If not, we recommend only the changes required to reach a safe foundation.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Engagement & Fit',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What if we are not a fit?',
        answer:
          'We will tell you directly. Not every business should invest in growth at every stage. Clarity is the goal.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there a long-term contract?',
        answer:
          'No lock-ins. Work proceeds only when it makes sense, phase by phase.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Ownership & Control',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Who owns the website and data?',
        answer:
          'You do. Domain, hosting, analytics, and code are owned by you. We work with delegated access only.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if we stop working together?',
        answer:
          'You keep everything. No platform lock-in. No dependency.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Expectations',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Do you guarantee results?',
        answer:
          'We do not promise outcomes before foundations are fixed. What we guarantee is clarity: you will know exactly whether your website is capturing customers — and what to do next.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does fixing take if leaks are found?',
        answer:
          'Most foundation fixes take between 2–4 weeks depending on scope. Exact timelines are explained after the scan.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you only work in Alberta?',
        answer:
          'Our focus is Alberta-based owner-led businesses. We occasionally work outside Alberta when fast decision-making and ownership access are clear.'
      }
