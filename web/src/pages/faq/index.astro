    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is the consultation?',
        answer:
          'The consultation is a working session where we evaluate whether building or scaling a client acquisition system makes financial sense for your business. It is not a sales call. The goal is clarity — not commitment.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Who is the consultation for?',
        answer:
          'Owner-led businesses typically generating $300K–$5M in annual revenue, with enough margin and capacity to absorb additional demand. If the economics do not support growth, we will say so.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens during the consultation?',
        answer:
          'We review your numbers at a high level (ticket size, margins, capacity), identify where demand or conversion is leaking, and determine whether fixing the system before scaling is the right move.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is the consultation free?',
        answer:
          'Yes. The consultation exists to determine fit. Implementation or ongoing work is discussed only if it makes sense for both sides.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you prepare anything before the call?',
        answer:
          'Yes. We review public signals such as your website, search presence, and positioning before the call so the conversation is focused and practical.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'How We Work',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What does BrandsBuilders actually do?',
        answer:
          'We help businesses evaluate, design, and operate client acquisition systems. That may involve websites, tracking, routing, local search, or paid channels — but only after the financial logic is clear.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you sell individual services?',
        answer:
          'No. We do not sell isolated services like “just ads” or “just a website” unless the system already supports it. Fragmented execution is how budgets get wasted.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you decide what to work on first?',
        answer:
          'We start with constraints: economics, capacity, and current leakage. Foundations come before traffic. If spending more will amplify inefficiency, we stop and fix the system first.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you work with existing tools and websites?',
        answer:
          'Yes. If your current setup meets performance, clarity, and tracking standards, we build on it. If not, we recommend minimal changes that improve outcomes rather than full rebuilds by default.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Engagement & Fit',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What happens if we are not a fit?',
        answer:
          'We will tell you directly. Not every business should invest in growth at every stage, and forcing execution when the economics do not support it creates losses.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there a long-term contract?',
        answer:
          'No lock-ins. Engagements are structured around clear phases and outcomes. Ongoing work continues only while it makes sense.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Ownership & Control',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Who owns the assets and data?',
        answer:
          'You do. Domains, websites, analytics, ad accounts, and content are owned by the client. We operate with delegated access and document handover.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if we stop working together?',
        answer:
          'You retain full access and ownership. Systems are documented so you are not dependent on us to operate or transition.'
      }
    ]
  },
 {
  category: 'Expectations & Guarantees',
  questions: [
    {
      question: 'Do you guarantee results?',
      answer:
        'Yes — under clearly defined conditions. For both Starter Local and Pro Local, we guarantee net positive profit from the system. If that is not achieved, we extend the engagement at no cost. If results still do not materialize, we provide a full refund. This guarantee applies as long as minimum execution conditions are met.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What conditions are required for the guarantee?',
      answer:
        'The guarantee applies when campaigns remain active without interruption, minimum ad spend requirements are met, required content is delivered on time, and execution recommendations are followed. These conditions exist to ensure results are driven by system performance, not execution gaps.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly should results appear?',
      answer:
        'Some improvements are immediate once friction is removed. Others require data accumulation over weeks. Starter Local focuses on fast proof within 30 days. Pro Local builds and stabilizes a scalable system over 8 weeks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if my business is not ready to scale?',
      answer:
        'We will say so. Not every business should scale at every moment. If the economics, capacity, or constraints do not support growth, we will recommend fixing fundamentals before investing further.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work only in Alberta?',
      answer:
        'Our focus is Alberta-based owner-led businesses. We occasionally work with teams outside Alberta when ownership, fast feedback, and decision-making authority are clear.'
    }
