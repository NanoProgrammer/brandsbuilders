    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is the Website Due Diligence Audit?',
        answer:
          'It is a structured review of your website’s performance, tracking, structure, and ownership. The goal is to determine whether your website is ready to safely handle more traffic — or if hidden risks need fixing first.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this a sales call?',
        answer:
          'No. The audit is a working session. You receive a clear Go / No-Go verdict on whether your website is ready to scale. Implementation is discussed only if it genuinely makes sense.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Who is the audit for?',
        answer:
          'Owner-led service businesses in Alberta that are planning to invest in growth and want clarity before spending more on ads, SEO, or redesigns.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is the audit free?',
        answer:
          'Yes. The audit exists to determine fit and uncover risks early. There is no obligation to proceed afterward.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you review anything before the call?',
        answer:
          'Yes. We review your website, Core Web Vitals, public search presence, and basic tracking signals in advance so the session is practical and focused.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'How We Work',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What does BrandsBuilders actually do?',
        answer:
          'We help businesses turn their websites into high-performance, fully owned growth assets. That may involve optimization, rebuilding, or system design — but only after risks are clearly identified.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you sell standalone services?',
        answer:
          'No. We do not sell isolated tactics like “just ads” or “just design.” Sending traffic to weak foundations wastes budget. Foundations come first.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do you decide what happens after the audit?',
        answer:
          'If the website is already strong, we explain how to scale safely. If risks are found, we outline the minimum work required to fix them. If growth is premature, we say so.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you work with my existing website?',
        answer:
          'Yes — if it meets performance, tracking, and ownership standards. If not, we recommend only the changes required to reach a safe foundation.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Engagement & Fit',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What if we are not a fit?',
        answer:
          'We will tell you directly. Not every business should invest in growth at every stage. Clarity is the goal.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there a long-term contract?',
        answer:
          'No lock-ins. Work proceeds only when it makes sense, phase by phase.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Ownership & Control',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Who owns the website and data?',
        answer:
          'You do. Domain, hosting, analytics, and code are owned by you. We work with delegated access only.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if we stop working together?',
        answer:
          'You keep everything. No platform lock-in. No dependency.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Expectations',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Do you guarantee results?',
        answer:
          'We do not promise outcomes before foundations are fixed. What we guarantee is clarity: you will know exactly whether your website is safe to scale — and what to do next.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does fixing take if risks are found?',
        answer:
          'Most website foundation fixes take between 2–4 weeks depending on scope. Exact timelines are explained after the audit.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you only work in Alberta?',
        answer:
          'Our focus is Alberta-based owner-led businesses. We occasionally work outside Alberta when fast decision-making and ownership access are clear.'
      }
