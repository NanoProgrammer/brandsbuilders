    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is the rebooking & reactivation system?',
        answer:
          'It is a done-for-you system that reactivates past clients, increases repeat bookings, and improves show-up rate using structured campaigns and follow-up flows — not more ads.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this marketing or software?',
        answer:
          'Neither. It is an implemented system. We design and install the flows, campaigns, and triggers for you. You are not managing tools or learning platforms.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Where do the bookings come from?',
        answer:
          'From your existing client database, recent customers, past inquiries, and missed follow-ups — not cold traffic.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How fast can results appear?',
        answer:
          'Most systems are designed to generate measurable booking activity within the first 60 days, often sooner depending on database size and service type.'
      }
    ]

  {
    category: 'Who It Is For',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Who is this designed for?',
        answer:
          'Alberta service businesses typically doing $300K–$3M+ per year with an existing client base and repeatable services.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this for new businesses?',
        answer:
          'No. If you do not yet have a client database or past customers, there is nothing to reactivate.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Which industries work best?',
        answer:
          'Fitness and coaching studios, med-aesthetic clinics, physio and specialty clinics, HVAC and home services, pest control, and other recurring or repeat-service businesses.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if my services are one-time only?',
        answer:
          'Then this system is usually not a fit. It works best where repeat visits or recurring services are normal.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'How Implementation Works',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What do you actually implement?',
        answer:
          'Client reactivation campaigns, repeat-booking triggers, show-up protection flows, and structured follow-up sequences — connected to your booking and contact systems.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I have to run campaigns myself?',
        answer:
          'No. We design and set up the flows and campaign logic. Your team only handles normal client communication and service delivery.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Does this replace my booking software?',
        answer:
          'No. We work with your existing booking or CRM tools when possible and add structure around them.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you need access to my client list?',
        answer:
          'Yes — secure access is required to implement reactivation and follow-up campaigns properly.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Risk & Guarantees',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Do you guarantee bookings?',
        answer:
          'We guarantee minimum booking outcomes when a business qualifies and implementation conditions are met. If minimum thresholds are not reached, refund and continued work terms apply.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Why do you offer guarantees?',
        answer:
          'Because this is a system built around measurable booking outcomes — not vague marketing activity.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there financial risk on my side?',
        answer:
          'Risk is reduced through qualification, minimum outcome guarantees, and short-term booking targets.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Engagement & Control',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Is there a long-term contract?',
        answer:
          'No long lock-ins. Engagement is based on implementation and outcome phases.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Who owns the client data and systems?',
        answer:
          'You do. We work with delegated access only. Your data and client relationships remain fully yours.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if we are not a fit?',
        answer:
          'We will say so directly. Not every business benefits from reactivation systems at every stage.'
