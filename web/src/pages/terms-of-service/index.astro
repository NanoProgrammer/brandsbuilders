              We operate one growth loop for owner-led SMBs: <strong>fast, accessible web</strong>, <strong>Local SEO/GBP</strong>, and
              <strong>paid media</strong>—tracked, tested and tuned to revenue. Engagements are <strong>form-first</strong>,
              with <strong>no public pricing</strong> and <strong>client-owned accounts</strong> by default.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By submitting an intake form, requesting a sprint, booking a call, signing a proposal, or paying an invoice, you agree to these Terms
              (“Terms”). If you accept on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have authority to bind that organization.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Hours & Support</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Operating hours:</strong> 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM, seven days a week (Alberta time).</li>
              <li><strong>Emergency:</strong> 24/7 support for existing clients facing critical lead-flow blockers or outages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Ideal Client Profile (Eligibility)</h2>
            <p>
              We prioritize owner-led SMBs (≈2–50 employees; typical revenue $250K–$1.5M+ CAD/yr) with high-value services (≥$150–$300 per booking)
              or healthy AOV e-commerce, visible digital gaps, and capacity to absorb more demand within 30–90 days. We may decline engagements that
              aren’t a fit (e.g., fully booked teams, committee decision-making, unrealistic promises).
            </p>

            <h2>4. Services & Operating Model</h2>
            <p>
              We don’t sell à la carte packages. Work is delivered inside a single operating model (“Growth Partner”), and—only when foundations already
              meet our standards—select capabilities may be operated individually.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Web & Conversion:</strong> design/dev, CWV performance, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 A/AA essentials), tracking, consent.</li>
              <li><strong>Local SEO & GBP:</strong> on-page optimization, schema, GBP hygiene (categories/hours/attributes/UTMs), reviews cadence.</li>
              <li><strong>Paid Media:</strong> audit & tracking sanity → keyword/angle research → initial build → data phase (~$50/day recommended) →
                query mining & negatives → iterative optimization + CRO/A/B on landings.</li>
              <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> dashboards as single source of truth, attribution sanity, insight reports (what changed, impact, next).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Deliverables, milestones, dependencies, and assumptions are defined in the proposal/SOW. Items not listed are <strong>out of scope</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Free 72-Hour Growth Sprint</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What it is:</strong> a free, limited-slot 3-day sprint focused on one high-impact area (e.g., landing speed/clarity/CTA or GBP visibility).</li>
              <li><strong>Before sprint:</strong> you complete a short application form (business, goal, industry, URL if available). We review and record a
                ~2-minute Loom using public data. Acceptance is at our discretion.</li>
              <li><strong>Access:</strong> initial Loom requires no access. If you approve implementation, you grant temporary collaborator/manager access;
                you remain full owner and may revoke access at any time.</li>
              <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> daily short updates and a final before→after Loom on Day 3. Scope is intentionally narrow and non-exhaustive.</li>
              <li><strong>No charges & no guarantee:</strong> the sprint is free and not an offer of ongoing services. Results and availability are not guaranteed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Fees, Deposits & Payments (Growth Partner)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Setup (one-time):</strong> foundations build/implementation. On delivery and payment, you own the site/code/content (see §11).</li>
              <li><strong>Operation (retainer):</strong> ongoing optimization billed in advance monthly.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance components (optional):</strong> lead bonuses or attributable revenue share may be added when meaningful and measurable, and will be stated in the SOW.</li>
              <li><strong>Third-party costs:</strong> media spend, SaaS, domains, apps, stock, fonts, etc. are client-funded in client-owned accounts.</li>
              <li><strong>Late payments:</strong> work may pause; statutory/contractual interest may apply.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Timelines, Inputs & Revisions</h2>
            <p>
              Schedules assume timely inputs, approvals, and access. Delays in content/feedback extend timelines. We work milestone-first with weekly check-ins.
              Unless stated otherwise, major deliverables include <strong>1–3 grouped rounds of revisions</strong>; net-new directions/extra rounds are billable.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Changes & Out-of-Scope</h2>
            <p>
              Material changes (new flows, features, integrations, languages, redesigns, rebrands) require a written change order with updated fees and timeline.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Platforms & Policies</h2>
            <p>
              We integrate with platforms such as Google, Microsoft Advertising, Meta, Shopify, Cloudflare, Vercel/Netlify, and analytics tools.
              You agree to comply with their terms and maintain accounts in good standing. Platform policies/pricing may change.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Performance, SEO, Accessibility & Ads Practices</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Performance:</strong> for new pages we target mobile Lighthouse ≥90 and LCP &lt; 2.5s, subject to media weight/third-party scripts; trade-offs documented.</li>
              <li><strong>SEO:</strong> no guarantees of rankings/traffic; we focus on durable inputs (on-page, schema, internal links, GBP hygiene, reviews).</li>
              <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> WCAG 2.1 A/AA essentials for shipped templates unless otherwise agreed.</li>
              <li><strong>Paid media:</strong> no guarantees of ROAS/volume. We mine queries, add negatives, adjust bids/budgets, and coordinate CRO/A/B to improve efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Intellectual Property & Ownership</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Client-owned accounts:</strong> wherever feasible, properties are created in client-owned accounts with appropriate roles.</li>
              <li><strong>Ownership transfer:</strong> upon full payment of amounts due, ownership of final approved deliverables transfers to you,
                excluding third-party assets, open-source components (under their licenses), and our internal libraries/process docs.</li>
              <li><strong>Pre-payment license:</strong> before full payment, you receive a temporary, revocable license for internal review only. No public launch until invoices are paid.</li>
              <li><strong>Working files:</strong> non-final explorations/working files are not deliverables unless explicitly included in the SOW.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>12. Portfolio Use & Case Studies</h2>
            <p>
              You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to reference non-confidential final work (screens, public URLs, approved metrics)
              in portfolio, site, and proposals. If you require NDA or delayed publicity, state it in the SOW and we will comply.
            </p>

            <h2>13. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
              Each party will protect the other’s non-public information and use it only to perform obligations under these Terms and the SOW.
            </p>

            <h2>14. Data, Privacy & Consent</h2>
            <p>
              Personal data is handled per our <a href="/privacy-policy" class="text-violet-300 underline">Privacy Policy</a>. We operate with
              <strong>minimal tracking and consent</strong> patterns aligned to Canadian privacy principles (PIPEDA). Where applicable, you are the
              controller of your customer data; we act as a service provider/processor. You are responsible for the truthfulness of claims, pricing,
              and representations in your content/ads.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Cancellations, Pauses & Refunds</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> you may cancel with written notice. Earned fees (including setup once work has begun) remain due; we deliver paid work-in-progress.</li>
              <li><strong>Pauses:</strong> if a project is inactive 21+ days due to missing inputs, we may pause and re-book; a restart fee may apply.</li>
              <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> payments are non-refundable once work has started, except where required by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>16. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>We warrant that deliverables will substantially conform to the SOW for 30 days after launch (60 days for checkout-blocking e-commerce defects we introduced).</li>
              <li>Except as stated, services are provided “as is”. We do not guarantee specific rankings, revenues, bookings, or ad performance outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>17. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability related to the services is limited to the fees actually paid to us for the specific SOW
              during the <strong>three (3) months</strong> preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages,
              including lost profits or data.
            </p>

            <h2>18. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your content, products, claims in ads, or misuse of deliverables, and from
              third-party disputes related to your operations or regulatory compliance.
            </p>

            <h2>19. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>
              Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control (e.g., platform outages or policy changes, strikes, natural disasters, governmental actions).
            </p>

            <h2>20. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta and applicable Canadian federal law. Parties will first attempt good-faith resolution.
              If unresolved, disputes will be submitted to binding arbitration in Alberta, conducted in English, with each party bearing its own costs.
            </p>

            <h2>21. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date.
              Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
            </p>
