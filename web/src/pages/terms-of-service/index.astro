        These Terms apply when you access this website, submit an intake form,
        request a consultation, sign a proposal, or pay an invoice.

      <h2>2. Services</h2>
      <p>
        Services may include website due diligence audits, conversion and
        funnel diagnostics, website and booking-flow optimization,
        tracking and measurement setup, and controlled acquisition scaling.
        Services are delivered only as described in a written proposal
        or statement of work (SOW).
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Scope, timelines, assumptions, and dependencies are defined per engagement.

      <h2>3. Consultations & Free Diagnostics</h2>
      <p>
        Consultations or diagnostics offered at no cost are limited in scope
        and provided at our discretion. They are not guarantees of acceptance
        into a paid engagement.
      </p>

        <li>Invoices are payable according to stated terms.</li>
        <li>Third-party costs (ads, software, domains) are paid by the client unless agreed otherwise.</li>

      <p>
        Certain paid engagements may include a conditional performance
        guarantee as defined in the applicable proposal or SOW.
        Guarantee terms, execution conditions, and measurement criteria
        are outlined per engagement.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The guarantee applies only when agreed execution conditions
        are met, including continuous operation, required spend levels,
        timely content delivery, and implementation of recommendations.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        If conditions are not met due to external factors,
        paused execution, or deviation from recommendations,
        the guarantee becomes void.
