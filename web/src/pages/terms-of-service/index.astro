      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">6. Performance Guarantee</h2>
        <p>
          Certain paid engagements may include a conditional performance
          guarantee as defined in the applicable proposal or SOW.
          Guarantee terms, required execution conditions, and measurement
          criteria are outlined per engagement.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The guarantee applies only when agreed execution conditions
          are met, including continuous campaign operation, required
          spend levels, timely content delivery, and implementation
          of recommended system changes.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          If guarantee conditions are not met due to external factors,
          business constraints, paused execution, or deviation from
          recommendations, the guarantee becomes void.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">7. No Absolute Guarantees</h2>
        <p>
          Except where explicitly stated in a written proposal,
          BrandsBuilders does not guarantee specific rankings,
          traffic volume, revenue, bookings, or advertising performance.
          Results depend on multiple factors outside our control.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Upon full payment, ownership of final deliverables transfers to you,
          excluding third-party assets, open-source components, and internal
          methodologies. Until payment is complete, deliverables are licensed
          for internal review only.

          To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability arising
          from any engagement is limited to the fees paid to us for the
          applicable SOW during the three (3) months preceding the claim.
