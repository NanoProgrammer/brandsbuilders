              Our business goal is simple: <strong>generate credibility, qualified leads, and more revenue for our clients</strong>.
              We work primarily with owner-led small & mid-market brands offering high-value services or products.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By requesting a quote, signing a proposal, paying an invoice or using our services, you agree to these Terms of Service
              (“Terms”). If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind
              that organization.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility & Fit (ICP)</h2>
            <p>
              We prioritize owner-led SMBs (2–50 employees, ~$300k–$5M+ revenue) with high-value services (≥$150–$300 per booking) or
              e-commerce AOV ≥$60, capacity to grow in 30–90 days, and minimum budgets from $5–8k (projects) or $1–2k/mo (retainers).
              We may decline projects that do not fit this profile (e.g., low ticket/fully booked/5+ decision makers/unrealistic promises).
            </p>

            <h2>3. Services & Scope</h2>
            <p>
              We provide brand identity, website design/development, local on-page SEO, e-commerce implementations, and content/media support.
              Deliverables, milestones, and assumptions are defined in the proposal or statement of work (the “SOW”). Items not listed there are
              <strong>out of scope</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Fees, Deposits & Payments</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Deposit (projects/packages):</strong> To reserve start dates and commence work, we require an
                <strong>upfront deposit of 50% of the minimum price of the selected service or package</strong> as publicly listed or quoted.
                This deposit is <strong>non-refundable</strong> once work begins.</li>
              <li><strong>Retainers:</strong> First month is billed in advance; subsequent months bill on the same date each month.</li>
              <li><strong>Milestones/Balance:</strong> Remaining amounts are invoiced per milestones or on completion, as stated in the SOW.</li>
              <li><strong>Late payments:</strong> May accrue interest and/or pause work until resolved.</li>
              <li><strong>Third-party costs:</strong> Domains, apps, SaaS, ads, stock, fonts and licenses are the client’s responsibility unless explicitly included
                (see any “Freebies” stated on our site/proposal).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Revisions</h2>
            <p>
              Unless otherwise stated in the SOW, packages include <strong>1–3 rounds of grouped revisions</strong> per major deliverable.
              Additional rounds or net-new directions are billable.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Timelines</h2>
            <p>
              Estimated timelines (e.g., 30–45 days for Small Business; 6–10 weeks for Mid-Market) assume prompt feedback, asset availability,
              and no material scope changes. We’ll flag risks and propose adjustments if dependencies slip.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Changes & Out-of-Scope</h2>
            <p>
              Material changes (new pages/features/integrations/languages/redesigns) require a change order with revised fees and timeline.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
            <p>
              We integrate with platforms such as Google, Meta, Shopify, Square, Acuity, Cloudflare. Their policies, pricing and availability may change.
              You agree to comply with their terms and maintain your accounts in good standing.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Performance, SEO & Accessibility</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Performance targets:</strong> For new pages we aim for mobile Lighthouse ≥ 90 and LCP &lt; 2.5s,
                subject to media weight and third-party scripts; trade-offs documented before shipping.</li>
              <li><strong>SEO:</strong> We do not guarantee rankings or traffic; we use sustainable, best-practice methods.</li>
              <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> We ship core WCAG 2.1 A/AA essentials on templates unless otherwise agreed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Intellectual Property & License</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ownership transfer:</strong> Upon full payment of all amounts due under the SOW, we assign to you the ownership of the final,
                approved deliverables (excluding third-party assets, open-source components under their licenses, and our internal libraries/tools).</li>
              <li><strong>Client license before final payment:</strong> Prior to full payment, you receive a temporary, revocable license for internal review only.
                No public use, launch, or distribution is permitted until invoices are paid in full.</li>
              <li><strong>Drafts & working files:</strong> Non-final explorations, drafts and working files are not deliverables unless explicitly included in the SOW.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Portfolio Use, Credits & Case Studies</h2>
            <p>
              You grant BrandsBuilders Agency a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to <strong>display, reference and link</strong> the final
              non-confidential work (screenshots, logos, public URLs, metrics you approve) in our website, portfolio, proposals and social channels to
              demonstrate capabilities and results. If you prefer to opt out (e.g., NDA), indicate it in writing in the SOW, and we will limit or defer
              publicity accordingly. Reasonable attribution (footer or credits page) may be included unless you request removal.
            </p>

            <h2>12. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
              Each party agrees to keep the other’s non-public information confidential and use it solely to perform obligations under these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>13. Data & Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Personal data is handled in accordance with our <a href="/privacy-policy" class="text-violet-300 underline">Privacy Policy</a>.
              Where applicable, you are the controller of your customer data; we are a service provider/processor.
            </p>

            <h2>14. Cancellations, Pauses & Refunds</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Client cancellation:</strong> You may cancel with written notice. Earned fees and the deposit remain due; we will deliver work-in-progress that is paid for.</li>
              <li><strong>Pauses:</strong> If a project is inactive for 21+ days due to missing inputs, we may pause and re-book the schedule; a restart fee may apply.</li>
              <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Due to the nature of creative/technical services, payments are non-refundable once work has begun, except where required by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>15. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>We warrant that deliverables will substantially conform to the SOW for 30 days after launch (60 days for checkout-blocking e-commerce issues).</li>
              <li>Except as stated, services are provided “as is”. We do not guarantee specific rankings, revenues, bookings, or ad results.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability related to the services is limited to the fees actually paid to us for the specific
              SOW during the <strong>3 months</strong> preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages,
              including lost profits or data.
            </p>

            <h2>17. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising from your content, products, ads, or misuse of deliverables, and from third-party
              disputes related to your business operations.
            </p>

            <h2>18. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>
              Neither party is liable for delays or failures due to events beyond reasonable control (e.g., outages, platform changes, strikes, natural disasters, governmental actions).
            </p>

            <h2>19. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta and applicable Canadian federal law. Parties will first attempt to resolve disputes in good faith.
              If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Alberta, conducted in English, with each party bearing its own costs.
            </p>

            <h2>20. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
              Continued use of our services after changes constitutes acceptance.
            </p>
