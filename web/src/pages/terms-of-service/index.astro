              Our focus is straightforward: <strong>build credibility, capture qualified demand, and grow revenue</strong>
              for owner-led SMBs through fast web experiences, pragmatic Local SEO/GBP, and disciplined Paid Search with CRO.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By requesting a quote, signing a proposal, paying an invoice, or using our services, you agree to these Terms of Service
              (“Terms”). If you enter these Terms on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Ideal Client Profile (Eligibility)</h2>
            <p>
              We prioritize owner-led SMBs (≈2–50 employees; ~$300k–$5M+ revenue) with high-value services (≥$150–$300 per booking) or
              e-commerce AOV ≥$60, visible digital gaps, and capacity to absorb more demand within 30–90 days. We may decline engagements that
              don’t fit (e.g., low ticket/fully booked/complex committees/unrealistic promises).
            </p>

            <h2>3. Services & Scope</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Web:</strong> Design/development, performance and accessibility improvements, analytics wiring, consent and tracking sanity.</li>
              <li><strong>Local SEO & GBP:</strong> On-page improvements, schema, GBP setup/optimization, reviews prompts, and measurement.</li>
              <li><strong>Paid Search:</strong> Audit & tracking sanity → keyword/angle research → account build → initial data phase
                (recommended CAD ~$50/day minimum) → query mining & negative keywords → iterative optimization + CRO/A/B tests on landings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Deliverables, milestones, dependencies, and assumptions will be defined in the proposal or statement of work (the “SOW”).
              Items not listed in the SOW are <strong>out of scope</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Fees, Deposits & Payments</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Month 1 — Setup (one-time):</strong> foundations build/implementation. On delivery, client owns the site/code/content (see §10).</li>
              <li><strong>Month 2+ — Retainer (fixed):</strong> ongoing operation/optimization billed in advance on a monthly cycle.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance components (optional):</strong> lead bonuses or attributable revenue share may be added if meaningful and measurable, and will be stated in the SOW.</li>
              <li><strong>Ads spend & third-party costs:</strong> All media spend, SaaS, domains, apps, stock, fonts, shipping apps, etc., are client-funded in client-owned accounts.</li>
              <li><strong>Late payments:</strong> Work may pause and statutory/contractual interest may apply until resolved.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Timelines & Client Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              Estimated timelines assume timely feedback, content/assets, and approvals. Delays in inputs or scope changes will impact schedule.
              We work milestone-first with weekly/bi-weekly check-ins and will flag risks promptly.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Revisions</h2>
            <p>
              Unless stated otherwise in the SOW, major deliverables include <strong>1–3 grouped rounds of revisions</strong>.
              Net-new directions or additional rounds are billable via change order.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Changes & Out-of-Scope</h2>
            <p>
              Material changes (new sections/pages, features, integrations, languages, redesigns, brand pivots) require a written change order with revised fees and timeline.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Platforms & Policies</h2>
            <p>
              We integrate with platforms such as Google, Bing, Shopify, Cloudflare, Vercel/Netlify, and analytics tools. Their policies, pricing,
              and availability may change. You agree to comply with their terms and maintain accounts in good standing.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Performance, SEO, Accessibility & Ads Practices</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Performance targets:</strong> For new pages we aim for mobile Lighthouse ≥90 and LCP &lt; 2.5s, subject to media weight and third-party scripts; trade-offs documented.</li>
              <li><strong>SEO:</strong> No guarantees of rankings or traffic; we apply durable, best-practice methods (on-page, schema, internal links, GBP hygiene).</li>
              <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> WCAG 2.1 A/AA essentials on shipped templates unless otherwise agreed.</li>
              <li><strong>Paid Search:</strong> No guarantees of ROAS/lead volume. We implement negative keywords, query mining, budgeting and bid adjustments,
                and coordinate CRO/A/B tests on landings to improve efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Intellectual Property & License</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ownership transfer:</strong> Upon full payment of all amounts due under the SOW, ownership of the final approved deliverables transfers to you,
                excluding third-party assets, open-source components (under their licenses), and our internal libraries/frameworks/process docs.</li>
              <li><strong>Pre-payment license:</strong> Before full payment, you receive a temporary, revocable license for internal review only. No launch or public use until invoices are paid.</li>
              <li><strong>Working files:</strong> Non-final explorations and working files are not deliverables unless explicitly included in the SOW.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Portfolio Use & Case Studies</h2>
            <p>
              You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to <strong>display and reference</strong> non-confidential final work (screens, public URLs,
              metrics you approve) in portfolio, website, and proposals. If you require NDA or delayed publicity, notify us in the SOW and we will comply.
            </p>

            <h2>12. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
              Each party will protect the other’s non-public information and use it solely to perform obligations under these Terms and the SOW.
            </p>

            <h2>13. Data & Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Personal data is handled per our <a href="/privacy-policy" class="text-violet-300 underline">Privacy Policy</a>. Where applicable, you are the controller of your customer data; we act as a service provider/processor.
              We prefer client-owned analytics/ad accounts with appropriate access controls.
            </p>

            <h2>14. Cancellations, Pauses & Refunds</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel with written notice. Earned fees (including the setup once work has begun) remain due; we will deliver paid work-in-progress.</li>
              <li><strong>Pauses:</strong> If a project is inactive 21+ days due to missing inputs, we may pause and re-book the schedule; a restart fee may apply.</li>
              <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Due to the nature of creative/technical services, payments are non-refundable once work has started, except where required by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>15. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>We warrant that deliverables will substantially conform to the SOW for 30 days after launch (60 days for checkout-blocking e-commerce defects we introduced).</li>
              <li>Except as stated, services are provided “as is”. We do not guarantee specific rankings, revenues, bookings, or ad performance outcomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability related to the services is limited to the fees actually paid to us for the specific SOW
              during the <strong>three (3) months</strong> preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages,
              including lost profits or data.
            </p>

            <h2>17. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your content, products, claims in ads, or misuse of deliverables, and from
              third-party disputes related to your operations or regulatory compliance.
            </p>

            <h2>18. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>
              Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control (e.g., platform outages or policy changes, strikes, natural disasters, governmental actions).
            </p>

            <h2>19. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta and applicable Canadian federal law. Parties will first attempt good-faith resolution.
              If unresolved, disputes will be submitted to binding arbitration in Alberta, conducted in English, with each party bearing its own costs.
            </p>

            <h2>20. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with an updated “Last updated” date.
              Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
            </p>
