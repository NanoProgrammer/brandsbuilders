      'How demand, funnel structure, and financial logic interact — and why most local businesses struggle to scale profitably.',
    content: `
      <p>
        Most service businesses don’t fail because of poor execution.
        They fail because they attempt to scale demand without understanding
        how acquisition, conversion, and unit economics interact.
      </p>

      <h2>Demand comes first</h2>
      <p>
        Before sending traffic, you must understand whether real demand
        exists in your area and how competitive that demand actually is.
        No funnel fixes a market that isn’t ready to buy.
      </p>

      <h2>Funnels leak quietly</h2>
      <p>
        Most funnels don’t collapse — they bleed.
        Small friction points compound:
        slow load time, unclear offer, weak routing,
        missing trust, broken tracking.
      </p>

      <h2>Financial logic decides everything</h2>
      <p>
        Scaling only works when margins, acquisition cost,
        and operational capacity align.
        If you don’t know your break-even acquisition cost,
        you are not running marketing — you are gambling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Client acquisition is not ads.
        It is a system.
        Systems scale. Guessing doesn’t.

    title: 'Why ads fail for most local businesses',
    excerpt:
      'The real reasons campaigns don’t work have less to do with platforms and more to do with economics, clarity, and trust.',
    content: `
      <p>
        When local businesses say “ads don’t work”,
        they usually blame the platform.
        The reality is simpler: the system underneath the ads is broken.
      </p>

      <h2>Traffic exposes weak foundations</h2>
      <p>
        Ads don’t create problems.
        They reveal them.
        Slow websites, unclear offers,
        missing tracking, poor routing,
        and weak trust signals
        turn paid traffic into paid leakage.
      </p>

      <h2>Most campaigns run blind</h2>
      <p>
        Without clean conversion tracking,
        businesses can’t see which clicks produce revenue.
        Decisions are made on impressions and gut feeling.
        That’s not marketing — it’s hope.
      </p>

      <h2>Economics matter more than platforms</h2>
      <p>
        If acquisition cost exceeds margin,
        scaling destroys profit.
        No ad optimization fixes broken unit economics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ads are accelerators.
        If the engine underneath is weak,
        pressing the gas only makes the crash faster.

    excerpt:
      'A breakdown of break-even logic and why scaling traffic can quietly destroy margins.',
    content: `
      <p>
        Growth is not always the right move.
        Scaling at the wrong time
        is one of the fastest ways to kill a healthy business.
      </p>

      <h2>Break-even is the real starting point</h2>
      <p>
        Before spending on acquisition,
        you must know your true break-even cost per lead or booking.
        If this number is unknown,
        every marketing decision is made in the dark.
      </p>

      <h2>Capacity is a hidden constraint</h2>
      <p>
        Many service businesses scale demand
        without the operational capacity to deliver.
        The result is slower response time,
        lower quality,
        damaged reputation —
        and churn.
      </p>

      <h2>Margin decides sustainability</h2>
      <p>
        If fulfillment costs, overhead,
        and acquisition cost leave no room for profit,
        more volume simply increases losses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real growth starts
        when economics, capacity, and systems
        are aligned.
        Everything else is noise.
