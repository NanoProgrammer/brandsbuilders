          Local market understanding
        </h3>
        <p>
          We work exclusively with Alberta-based service and local businesses.
          This means demand analysis, channel selection, and financial logic
          are grounded in real regional conditions — not generic benchmarks.

          Systems before traffic
        </h3>
        <p>
          We do not push ads or scale activity before understanding where
          customers drop off, how demand behaves, and whether the economics
          of acquisition actually make sense.
        </p>

          Financial-first thinking
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every recommendation is tied to margins, break-even logic, and
          operational reality. If scaling traffic would lose money,
          we will say so clearly.
