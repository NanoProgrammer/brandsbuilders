          Alberta-specific market reality
        </h3>
        <p>
          We work exclusively with Alberta-based service businesses.
          Demand signals, competition, and customer behavior are analyzed
          using real local conditions — not generic benchmarks.
        </p>

          Websites before traffic
        </h3>
        <p>
          We do not increase ad spend or traffic before verifying that
          your website, tracking, and booking flow are ready to convert
          demand without silent leakage.
        </p>

          Risk-first, profit-aware execution
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every recommendation is tied to performance, break-even logic,
          and operational capacity. If scaling would introduce risk or loss,
          we say so clearly — before money is spent.
