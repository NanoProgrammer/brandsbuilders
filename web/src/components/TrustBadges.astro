          Built for Alberta service businesses
        </h3>
        <p>
          We work exclusively with owner-led service businesses in Alberta.
          The websites we build reflect local demand patterns, urgency,
          and how customers actually choose providers — not generic templates.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-white font-medium mb-2">
          We build first — you decide after
        </h3>
        <p>
          Instead of selling promises, audits, or mockups,
          we build the actual website upfront.
          You review the real system before deciding whether to move forward.
        </p>

          Low risk. High accountability.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The risk is on us, not you.
          If the website doesn’t meet expectations for performance,
          structure, or clarity — you don’t proceed.
          That keeps execution honest and aligned with results.
